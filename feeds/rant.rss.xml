   <description>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran across this post on Rick Hightower’s blog the other day titled &lt;a href="http://www.jroller.com/RickHigh/entry/thanks_zed_btw_syntax_matters"&gt;Thanks Zed&lt;/a&gt;. I have to agree with Rick on many points, especially that Java should stop wasting it’s time with supporting JRuby and instead focus those efforts on Groovy and Grails. Like Rick, I had bought several Rails books and after it was all said and done, I wasn’t really that impressed. I am a huge fan of the whole “Convention Over Configuration” paradigm, but I guess I just wasn’t ready to give up on Java just yet and jump on the Rails bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
