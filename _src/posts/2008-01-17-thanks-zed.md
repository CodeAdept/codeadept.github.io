I ran across this post on Rick Hightower’s blog the other day titled [Thanks Zed](http://www.jroller.com/RickHigh/entry/thanks_zed_btw_syntax_matters).  I have to agree with Rick on many points, especially that Java should stop wasting it’s time with supporting JRuby and instead focus those efforts on Groovy and Grails.  Like Rick, I had bought several Rails books and after it was all said and done, I wasn’t really that impressed.  I am a huge fan of the whole “Convention Over Configuration” paradigm, but I guess I just wasn’t ready to give up on Java just yet and jump on the Rails bandwagon.
